# 🕵️ The Watchman’s Residue — Holmes 2025 (Blue Team)

> **Scenario:** With help from **D.I. Lestrade**, Holmes acquires logs from a compromised **MSP** tied to the city’s financial core. The MSP’s **AI helpdesk bot** appears to have been manipulated into **leaking remote access keys** — an old trick of **Moriarty**.

> Despite being tagged as Medium, this one was the toughest accordingly to all player. The evidence pack centered on a Windows endpoint and MSP telemetry: a Windows triage image, **RMM logs**, and a **PCAP** (network capture). My goal was to correlate host artifacts with remote-access activity and network beacons to rebuild the operator’s timeline.  
**Transparency:** I solved **12/19** questions during the event. After the CTF ended, we received **3 extra days** to keep working (not counted toward the final score). I used that window to refine my notes and continue digging.



## Executive Summary
An attacker abused an MSP’s **AI helpdesk** to obtain **remote access credentials**, then used (or installed) **RMM** components to maintain access on a Windows endpoint. Host triage artifacts (services, scheduled tasks, PowerShell logs, Amcache/Prefetch) and **PCAP** traffic show **beaconing** and limited **file transfer** activity. By correlating **RMM logs**, **Windows triage**, and **network captures**, I rebuilt the sequence of actions, identified **persistence**, and extracted **IOCs**.

**Outcome:** A working, minute-level timeline; confirmed persistence mechanism; prioritized IOCs for blocking; concrete hardening steps for MSP/RMM exposure.

## Challenge Brief
- **Goal:** Build an accurate **incident timeline** from multi-source evidence and answer scenario questions.
- **Focus Areas:**  
  1) Initial access via **AI-assisted credential leakage**  
  2) **RMM misuse** for remote control and persistence  
  3) **Network** indicators (DNS/TLS/C2) and potential exfil
- **Provided Evidence:** Windows triage image, **RMM logs**, **PCAP**.


---

## Artifacts & Tools
**Evidence**
- Windows triage image (`C:\` system & user artifacts)
- RMM telemetry/logs (sessions, transfers, script exec)
- Packet capture (PCAP)

**Primary Parsers/Utilities**
- **Windows:** `evtxexport/evtx_dump`, `grep`, `awk`, `python3`
- **Timeline:** `log2timeline.py` 
- **Network:** Wireshark / `tshark` 

---

 **Question 1:**

> What is the IPv4 address of the **decommissioned host** that initiated the chat with **MSP-HELPDESK-AI**?

Pivoted through the PCAP (`/api/messages` and `/api/messages/send`) and confirmed the attacker’s POST requests originated from the same source IP shown in the capture.
Here is the chat history important for this challenge:
