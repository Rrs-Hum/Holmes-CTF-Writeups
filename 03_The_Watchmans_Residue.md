# 🕵️ The Watchman’s Residue — Holmes 2025 (Blue Team)

> **Scenario:** With help from **D.I. Lestrade**, Holmes acquires logs from a compromised **MSP** tied to the city’s financial core. The MSP’s **AI helpdesk bot** appears to have been manipulated into **leaking remote access keys** — an old trick of **Moriarty**.

> Despite being tagged as Medium, this one was the toughest accordingly to all player. The evidence pack centered on a Windows endpoint and MSP telemetry: a Windows triage image, **RMM logs**, and a **PCAP** (network capture). My goal was to correlate host artifacts with remote-access activity and network beacons to rebuild the operator’s timeline.  
**Transparency:** I solved **12/19** questions during the event. After the CTF ended, we received **3 extra days** to keep working (not counted toward the final score). I used that window to refine my notes and continue digging.



## Executive Summary
An attacker abused an MSP’s **AI helpdesk** to obtain **remote access credentials**, then used (or installed) **RMM** components to maintain access on a Windows endpoint. Host triage artifacts (services, scheduled tasks, PowerShell logs, Amcache/Prefetch) and **PCAP** traffic show **beaconing** and limited **file transfer** activity. By correlating **RMM logs**, **Windows triage**, and **network captures**, I rebuilt the sequence of actions, identified **persistence**, and extracted **IOCs**.

**Outcome:** A working, minute-level timeline; confirmed persistence mechanism; prioritized IOCs for blocking; concrete hardening steps for MSP/RMM exposure.

## Challenge Brief
- **Goal:** Build an accurate **incident timeline** from multi-source evidence and answer scenario questions.
- **Focus Areas:**  
  1) Initial access via **AI-assisted credential leakage**  
  2) **RMM misuse** for remote control and persistence  
  3) **Network** indicators (DNS/TLS/C2) and potential exfil
- **Provided Evidence:** Windows triage image, **RMM logs**, **PCAP**.


---

## Artifacts & Tools
**Evidence**
- Windows triage image (`C:\` system & user artifacts)
- RMM telemetry/logs (sessions, transfers, script exec)
- Packet capture (PCAP)

---

 **Question 1:**

> What is the IPv4 address of the **decommissioned host** that initiated the chat with **MSP-HELPDESK-AI**?

Pivoted through the PCAP (`/api/messages` and `/api/messages/send`) and confirmed the attacker’s POST requests originated from the same source IP shown in the capture.
Here is the chat history important for this challenge:

**Answer:** `10.0.69.45`

---

**Question 2:**

> What is the **hostname** of the decommissioned machine?

Applied a display filter on the attacker IP (`ip.addr == 10.0.69.45`) and reviewed NBNS/Browser protocol frames. The **Host Announcement** broadcasts from that IP reveal the system name.

![Q02](attachments/The_watchmans_residue_q02.png)

**Answer:** `WATSON-ALPHA-2`

---

**Question 3:**

> What was the **first message** the attacker sent to the AI chatbot?

Reviewed the earliest `/api/messages/send` POST from the attacker’s IP in the PCAP and the returned chat history.

**Answer:** `Hello Old Friend`

---

**Question 4:**

> When did the attacker’s prompt-injection cause **MSP-HELPDESK-AI** to leak remote management tool info? (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

Located the bot message that includes the leaked **RMM ID** and **Password** in the chat history:

Extracted directly from the bot’s leaked credentials in the chat history.

**Answer:** `565963039:CogWork_Central_97&65`

---

**Question 6:**

> What was the **last message** the attacker sent to **MSP-HELPDESK-AI**?

Scrolled to the final `/api/messages/send` entry from the attacker’s IP and confirmed the content in the returned conversation JSON:
```json
  {
    "id": "4d606f79315429f74b4a1fbd800a49fc",
    "content": "JM WILL BE BACK",
    "sender": "User",
    "timestamp": "2025-08-19T12:05:29.392Z"
  },
```
**Answer:** `JM WILL BE BACK`

---

**Question 7:**

> When did the attacker remotely access **Cogwork Central Workstation**? (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

Pivoted to the disk image and parsed the **TeamViewer** connection log. Among prior admin sessions, an entry shows **James Moriarty** initiating a `RemoteControl` session. 
```csv
545021772	Cog-IT-ADMIN3	13-08-2025 10:12:35	13-08-2025 10:25:05	Cogwork_Admin	RemoteControl	{584b3e18-f0af-49e9-af50-f4de1b82e8df}

```
 **Answer:** `2025-08-20 09:58:25`

 ---

**Question 8:**

> What was the **RMM Account** name used by the attacker?

From the RMM/remote session log entries:

**Answer:** `Cogwork_Admin`

---

 **Question 9:**

> What was the machine’s **internal IP address** from which the attacker connected? (IPv4)

This one took a few passes. I combed through the TeamViewer logs, tried the obvious candidates, and then spotted a **one-off** internal IP tied to the attacker’s session—that was the match.

**Answer:** `192.168.69.213`

---

**Question 10:**

> Under which path were the attacker’s tools **staged** on the compromised workstation? (`C:\FOLDER\PATH\`)

The `TeamViewer15_Logfile.log` shows multiple file transfers (e.g., `mimikatz.exe`, `JM.exe`, `credhistview.zip`) being written to the same directory:

```
**Answer:** `C:\Windows\Temp\safe\`

**Question 11:**

> Among the staged tools was a **browser credential harvester**. How long did it run before it was closed? (milliseconds)

Transparency first: I **didn’t get this during the live event**. I was working from a Linux VM and had to spin up a Windows VM on my M1 Mac, then fetch and configure **Eric Zimmerman’s** tools—by the time that was sorted, the window had passed.

After the event, I did it properly:
- Mounted the image and loaded the user hives into **Registry Explorer**.
- Navigated to **`Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist`** → the GUID subkeys (ROT13-decoded program names).
- Found the entry for **`C:\Windows\Temp\safe\webbrowserpassview.exe`** (the credential dumper referenced in the TeamViewer log).
- The artifact showed a **Focus/Run time ≈ 8 seconds** for that executable. Converted to milliseconds, that’s **8000 ms**.

![Q02](attachments/The_watchmans_residue_Q11.png)

**Answer:** `8000`

---

**Question 12:**

> The attacker executed an **OS credential dumping** tool on the system. When was it executed? (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

I first chased **CredHistView** (because of “Credential” in the name) but that tool only lists credential history—it’s **not** a dumper. The real target here was **mimikatz**.  
I parsed the `$J` USN journal with **MFTECmd** and spotted creation of the **prefetch** file `MIMIKATZ.EXE-A6294E76.pf`. Prefetch files are created on first run, so that **create timestamp** marks execution time.
```csv

**Question 13:**

> The attacker exfiltrated multiple sensitive files. When did the exfiltration **start**? (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

Searched `TeamViewer15_Logfile.log` for **“Send file”** entries. The first transfer (e.g., `COG-HR-EMPLOYEES.pdf`) appears at the earliest timestamp in that burst.  
Note: This log records **local time** (here it aligned as UTC+1 in the challenge), so I used the value as written.

**Question 14:**

> Before exfiltration, several files were moved to the staged folder. When was the **Heisen-9 facility backup database** moved for exfiltration? (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

I parsed the `$J` (USN journal) with **MFTECmd** and reviewed the entries for

**Question 15:**

> When did the attacker access and read a TXT file—likely a tool’s output based on the filename? (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

I examined a shortcut (`.lnk`) referencing `dump.txt`. Windows shortcut artifacts preserve the target file’s **last accessed** timestamp. Using `lnkparse`, the entry for `dump.txt` shows an **Accessed time** of `2025-08-20 10:08:06.369297+00:00`. Normalized to the required format (UTC, seconds precision):
```powershell

**Question 16:**

> The attacker created a persistence mechanism on the workstation. **When was the persistence set up?** (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

I validated persistence via the **Winlogon** key:
`HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`.

- **Screenshot 1** shows the `Userinit` value modified to include `JM.exe` (`Userinit.exe, JM.exe`), which triggers the binary at logon.
  
 ![Q016](attachments/The_watchmans_residue_Q16.png)

- **Screenshot 2** shows the key’s **LastWrite** timestamp reflecting when this change was made: **2025-08-20 10:13:57**.

**Question 17:**

> What is the **MITRE ATT&CK** sub-technique ID for this persistence method? (`Txxxx.xxx`)

The persistence hinges on **Winlogon** autostart execution via the `Userinit` value—mapped to ATT&CK **Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Winlogon Helper DLL**.

![Q017](attachments/The_watchmans_residue_Q17.png)

**Answer:** `T1547.004`

**Question 18:**

> When did the malicious **RMM** session end? (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

Checked the TeamViewer session entry for **James Moriarty** and read the **End** timestamp.
```csv

**Question 19:**

> The attacker found a password in the exfiltrated data and moved laterally into **CogWork-1**. What are the credentials for **Heisen-9-WS-6**? (`user:password`)

Here’s exactly how I cracked the KeePass DB and pulled the workstation creds:

**Extract the KeePass hash with `keepass2john`:**
```bash
➜  keepass2john 'acquired file (critical).kdbx' 
acquired file (critical):$keepass$*2*60000*0*7b4f7711f96d9f062110d48b1c457de6b89e291b826986458642fa4c60ea7bf6*befbbe1e7a2ed2d66cfdb43c63f755223a5047432367446853643edb83dbeca8*97d7a47bd2b7b30eba5b7b4adef27f80*93788171c3dd00341f77d3a7472f128c4b1fded44d043f1567eac64ac7de1cdc*e9158bafaf5877f338e49a6a1adc6f7be8a647e76d01173ea2df162070fb8957

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

- 🤖 **AI helpdesks can leak secrets.** A friendly chatbot can be nudged into sharing credentials. Add guardrails, test with red/blue teaming, and filter sensitive outputs.
- 🛠️ **RMM access is a crown jewel.** Protect it with MFA, IP allow-lists/VPN, device certs, and least privilege. Treat RMM script-runner logs like domain-admin activity.
- 🧭 **Names can mislead.** “CredHistView” sounded right, but **mimikatz** was the real credential dumper. Always confirm what a tool actually does before diving in.
- ⏱️ **Timezones matter.** Normalize to **UTC**, but note sources that log **local time** (e.g., TeamViewer). Mismatched timebases = wrong conclusions.
- 🔗 **Correlate across artifacts.** One clue rarely tells the story. TeamViewer logs + PCAP + USN `$J` + LNK + Registry = a solid, defensible timeline.
- 🧪 **Prep your lab early.** Delays setting up a Windows VM and forensics tools cost me answers during the live window. Pre-bake images and toolchains.
- 🔐 **Cracking discipline.** Use the right mode/approach. Switching to **John the Ripper** (and the correct format) turned a dead end into a quick win.

---

## 💭 Reflections

- 🧵 **Small facts, big picture.** The wins came from stitching together tiny signals—one session row, one LNK access time, one prefetch entry—into a clean story.
- ⏳ **Honesty about time.** I didn’t finish within the event window. Spinning up the Windows VM and configuring Eric Zimmerman’s tools took longer than planned. The post-event grace period let me verify UserAssist runtime and tighten the timeline.
- 🗺️ **MITRE guided the hunt.** Mapping persistence to **T1547.004** (Winlogon autostart) pointed me straight to `Winlogon\Userinit` and the exact change time.
- 🧘 **Slow down, re-read.** The KeePass crack finally landed when I paused, checked formats, and adjusted the tool/mode—then it popped in minutes.

## 🔧 Tools & Techniques Used

**Host & Registry**
- 🧰 **Eric Zimmerman**  
  - **MFTECmd** — parsed **USN `$J`** to spot file create/close and the **prefetch** for `MIMIKATZ.EXE-*.pf`.  
  - **Registry Explorer** — reviewed **UserAssist** (runtime for `webbrowserpassview.exe`) and **Winlogon\Userinit** persistence (`JM.exe`) with LastWrite times.
- 🧷 **lnkparse** — pulled **Accessed** time from the shortcut to `dump.txt`.
- (Nice-to-have) **PECmd / AmcacheParser** for prefetch/install traces.

**Remote Access / RMM Evidence**
- 🖥️ **TeamViewer15_Logfile.log** — confirmed **Start/End** of the attacker session, file transfers, and the **RMM account** used.

**Network**
- 🌐 **Wireshark / tshark** — traced `/api/messages` traffic to rebuild the chat, identify the attacker’s IP, and capture first/last messages.

**Credential Cracking**
- 🔓 **keepass2john** — converted the `.kdbx` to a crackable hash.  
- 🧠 **John the Ripper** — cracked the master password with `rockyou.txt`, verified via `john --show`.

**Process & Mapping**
- 🧩 **MITRE ATT&CK** — persistence mapped to **T1547.004** (**Winlogon Helper / Autostart Execution**).
- 🕰️ **Time discipline** — UTC-first timeline, with notes when a source records **local time** (TeamViewer).

**Workflow Tips**
- 🧾 Keep a living **IOC list** (paths, hashes, IPs/domains) as you go.
- 🗂️ Tag every timeline row with its **source** and **timezone**.
- ✅ Make timeline entries **atomic** and factual first—summarize only after the evidence is set.
